# GhostText: Simple, Boring, Effective


## üéØ Refined Core Concept

GhostText will be a **deliberately boring application** that allows two people to communicate securely when they can't openly chat. The key principles:

1. **Mundane Appearance**: UI that looks tedious and work-related
2. **Simple Usability**: Easy to use without special training
3. **Effective Security**: Messages hidden in plain sight
4. **Natural Interaction**: Using it shouldn't look suspicious

## üñ•Ô∏è The Perfect Disguise: "The Spreadsheet"

Instead of multiple personas, let's perfect a single, universally boring disguise: **a data entry spreadsheet**. Why?

- **Universal Boredom**: Almost nobody wants to look at someone else's spreadsheet
- **Expected Behavior**: Typing in cells is normal behavior
- **Long Usage**: People expect spreadsheets to be used for extended periods
- **Plausible in Any Setting**: Work, school, home - spreadsheets are everywhere

## üß© Key Features

### 1. **Spreadsheet Interface**
- Looks like a standard data entry form or budget tracker
- Grid layout with columns for dates, categories, numbers
- Boring color scheme (grays, light blues)
- Realistic spreadsheet functions and formulas visible

### 2. **Hidden Chat System**
- Messages appear as "notes" or "comments" on spreadsheet cells
- Typing a message looks like entering data or formulas
- Notifications disguised as spreadsheet validation alerts
- Chat history hidden among spreadsheet revision history

### 3. **Simple Activation**
- Double-click specific cell to toggle between spreadsheet/chat mode
- Or use a simple keyboard shortcut that looks like normal spreadsheet use (e.g., Alt+N for "new note")
- Visual indicator of chat mode is subtle (slightly different border color)

### 4. **One-Key Security**
- Single shared password/key for both users
- Enter once at the beginning of session
- "Lock" button disguised as "Save" or "Calculate" function
- Auto-lock after period of inactivity

## üîÑ User Flow

1. **Open App**: Looks like loading a spreadsheet or budget tracker
2. **Enter Key**: Disguised as "loading file" or "accessing cloud data"
3. **Normal Mode**: See spreadsheet with embedded messages (if decrypted)
4. **Send Message**: 
   - Click cell (looks like selecting for editing)
   - Type message (looks like entering data)
   - Press Enter (normal spreadsheet behavior)
5. **Read Messages**: Appear as cell notes or formula results
6. **Quick Exit**: "Save & Close" button that instantly locks everything

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **React + Tailwind**: For building the spreadsheet interface
- **CSS Grid**: For authentic spreadsheet layout
- **Web Crypto API**: For message encryption

### Backend
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Store encrypted messages
- **Cloud Functions**: Handle message expiration

### Security
- **Client-side Encryption**: Messages encrypted before sending
- **No Message Storage**: Option to auto-delete after reading
- **Minimal Metadata**: Store only what's necessary

## üì± Mobile Considerations

- **Responsive Design**: Spreadsheet adjusts to mobile screens
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger touch targets disguised as cell padding
- **Mobile-Specific Gestures**: Long-press instead of right-click for context menus
